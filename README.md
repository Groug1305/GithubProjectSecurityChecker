## Disclaimer: this repo exists for EDUCATIONAL purposes only.

Lightweight app made specifically to check python repositories on having vulnerable/shady libs.
The main difference from other SAST apps is that fetches info from Github repo directrly, without needing in any cloning target repos to your computer beforehand.
Special shoutout to Bandit tool developers for their incredible tool.
To be mainteined.
